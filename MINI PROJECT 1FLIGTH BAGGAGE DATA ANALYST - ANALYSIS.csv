Key Insights,,,,,
"- DPS–SIN is the highest-volume route for baggage add-on transactions
- Higher transaction volume is associated with a higher frequency of issuance errors
- Routes contributing the most baggage revenue also carry the highest operational risk
- Error monitoring should prioritize transaction volume rather than route count alone
",,,,,
Recommendations,,,,,
"- Prioritize additional quality control checks on DPS–SIN due to its high baggage transaction volume
- Implement error monitoring dashboards for high-impact routes
- Provide targeted refresher training for agents handling high-volume baggage issuance
- Regularly review baggage issuance performance to reduce revenue leakage
- Optimizing high-volume routes can help reduce issuance errors while protecting baggage revenue  ",,,,,
